seated on a throne of nine-layered silks,To Khenpo Śāntarakṣita on a throne of five-layered
silks,And to Vairocana and the three chief lotsawas,On silken cushions to the right

spoke the following words:

“Emaho!

Great Son of the Victorious Ones, you who know the three times —My lord and father, Trisong
Deutsen, has passed away,And you, beacon of the teachings, are leaving for the land of rākṣasas,Whilst
we Tibetans are stuck with our short lives, fraught with distractions.And so,
in this final age, for those who remain,I request a concise teaching on the sacred Dharma’s
meaning —A powerful prayer to you, our Guru,A summary of your life and liberation!”

This concludes the sixteenth chapter, The Eight Revealers of My Treasures, who are Lords of
the Dharma:

Emaho!

Listen well, great king!I, Padma Jungné possess the five mundane and the five super-mundane
perceptions.It is with these perceptions that I know and understand.Previously, I have been
the Buddha of Infinite Light, Amitābha, the Protector Avalokiteśvara of Mount Potala, and
Padma Jungné of Dhanakośa. Although these each arise as the expression of the three kāyas,
they are ultimately inseparable and indivisible.Abiding in the dharmadhātu is Samantabhadra;
in Ghanavyūha is the great Vajradhara; and in Bodhgaya is the Great Sage himself.[34]
Inseparably, they are all spontaneously accomplished within myself, Orgyen.Therefore, always
pray to me!The king’s descendants will be a hundred and thirteen in number, after which
a Tartar emperor from China will lead an invading army into Tibet, laying to waste the
people and the land, and destroying my temples.At that time, there will be a man known as
Sakya, an emanation of mine.In the region of Tö,[35] there will be a man named Jampal and
a woman named Drolma.They will be the parents of a son, Kunga Gyaltsen, Noble Protector of
Beings.He will rebuild my temples and spread the teachings of Secret Mantra far and wide,
bringing happiness and wellbeing to the people of Tibet.Later, greedy kings will take the
throne, some of them acting like Dharma kings, and others like demons.Some kings will establish
the laws of Dharma, while others will destroy them.During these times, people will
constantly rise and fall.An emanation of Atiśa, foretold by the Buddha and known as Lobzang,
will appear in the mountain ranges of Do Kham.[36] Through him, happiness and wellbeing
will dawn once again in this land of Tibet, and virtuous people will regain courage.A fort
will be built in Lower Nyang at Nyima Do and a temple will be built on the red mountains
at Lhasa.Then, my emanation, Orgyen Lingpa will appear and reveal twenty-five treasures.”

At these words, the king began to weep.Prostrating many times, and offering a maṇḍala, he asked:“Guide
of beings, Great Teacher, please tell me of the future of my lineage and the wellbeing
of the Tibetan people. Great Mahāguru, please tell me these things.”He then bowed
in deep devotion.

The great Guru replied: “From this time on, your royal lineage in Tö will start to disappear,
like fog on a mirror.A new king will come, an extraordinary bodhisattva emanation, endowed
with the characteristics found in the Sūtra of the Fortunate Aeon.[37]This freckle-faced
king will have dominion over Tibet’s great cities, and the sun of happiness will shine without
casting any shadows.However, in the horse, sheep and monkey years, a Chinese army will
come.In the water male monkey year, there will be a military camp at Yarlung.[38]Finally,
Tibet will be annexed under Chinese rule.There will be discord within families and there
will be war with mounted cavalry.In Bumthang,[39] there will be defeat in all sectors of
the kingdom.

Then an emanation of myself will return to protect the Dharma, right across the empire.There
will be civil war in Nepal and the sun of happiness will grow dim in Tibet.Have no doubt:
it is bad conduct that brings forth dark times.The times don’t change themselves — it is
people who change them.At this time, beings will not be known for their merit.During the day,
always pray to me, Pema Jungné.Meditate on the Great Compassionate One;Direct your hearts
to others’ benefit, recite the maṇi mantra.Show kindness to the six classes of beings,
all of them your fathers and mothers.At night, meditate on me, Pema Jungné,And recite for
your own benefit the vajra guru mantra.I will protect all sentient beings throughout this
degenerate age.I will watch over you uninterruptedly, throughout the three times.Thus, even
if you are reborn in the three lower realms, you will be redeemed.Although I’ve shown great
kindness to Tibet, beings remain persistently ungrateful.Yet, through the power of continuous
prayers to me, I will avert all negativity, even at the very worst of times.At that
darkest of points, an emanation of Maitreya, named Trudün will appear, and liberate beings
from suffering.Once again, times will turn positive and happiness will increase.Again
and again, beings will have visions of the Buddha.Day in and day out, I will come for the
benefit of TibetAnd I will sleep at the door of all those who have faith.My human body will
never again pass away or take rebirth.You, Mutri Tsenpo, will benefit beings for seventeen
lifetimesAnd then you will go to Uḍḍiyāna, the land of the ḍākinīs.You, Lotsawa Vairocana,
must take this profound life story,the Dharma of Padma,and hide it in the main temple
of glorious Samyé,to be passed on, in the future, to someone with the right karmic connection.


I cannot stay longer, but must go to tame the rakṣasas,To turn them to the Dharma, without a
single exception.And so I take my leave,Now that Tibet has been established within the Dharma.”


With these words, Padma Jungné turned his gaze to the south-west.

Samaya! Seal! Seal!

I, the treasure revealer Orgyen Lingpa, revealed this treasure from Samyé Chimphu. [40] Fortunate
ones with a karmic connection, keep it close to your heart, this treasure of the profound
life and liberation of the Guru Padma! If you read it once — clear, correct and in a
pleasant tone — this will be equal to reading the whole of the Pema Kathang. [41] Sentient
beings of this degenerate age have short lives and manifold diseases. They are afflicted
by plagues of planetary spirits, nāgas and gyalpos, which bring hindrances and death. Succumbing
to distractions, sentient beings have lost the support and protection of deities and
spirits. If you set your mind in alignment with this story of life and liberation, and
recite it a hundred or a thousand times, you will find that negativity will decrease and positivity
increase.

Thus, having pacified all adventitious obstacles,All evil spirits, all obstructing forces,May
our bodies become indestructible, like vajras!Throughout this life, may all adversities
be pacified,And in the next, may we be reborn in the realm of Lotus Light!

The quintessence of this concise Life and LiberationOf the Great Orgyen, Pema Jungné,Has been
put into writing by me, his devoted followerIn order to benefit both myself and others.

May the lives of great beings be long!May there be an ocean of happiness and bliss!May all mother-like
beings,Starting with my parents,Purify their obscurations,Perfect the two accumulations,Swiftly
attain the unexcelled state,And be reborn in the sovereign pureland — Lotus
Light!

May virtue increase!
